# multi_input_excel_engine
Excel Batch Runner is a compact Python utility that automates repetitive calculations stored in an Excel workbook. Drop any multi-row design sheet into the repository; the script loops through every row, applies your custom logic—whether that’s sizing, costing, or simulation—and writes the aggregated results to a clean output file.
